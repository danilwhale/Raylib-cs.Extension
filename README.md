# Raylib-cs.Extension
## attempt to make oop using extensions on top of raylib-cs

Raylib-cs.Extension project is separated to original raylib modules:
- Raylib_cs.Extension.Core - rcore
- i didn't make anything except rcore lmao

there's also Raylib-cs.Extension.Game project to test things i made and verify them

---

to use this coolest library you need:
- raylib-cs (at least 4.5.0.4)
- net 6.0 (based version)
